# rock-reconstruction
This image reconstruction consists of  a 24 aerial images taken above a rock near Goat Rock Beach in Sonoma, CA. They contain information gathered on board the craft that captured them including yaw, pitch, roll as well as latitude, longitude, and altitude. They can be used to create a 3-D construction of the rock itself.

This code is the first stage of this reconstruction which involves placing the images correctly to create a mosaic to draw all these images in the correct location on the plane.
